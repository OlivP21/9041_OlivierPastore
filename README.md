# 9041_OlivierPastore
Olivier Pastore Repository for 9041 Final Report


SRS SST data from AODN, cleaned, processed, and created a spatial timeseries average. This timeseries can then be run through HeatWaveR for event identification and graphical presentation. Analysis and identification of 2021/2022 MHW in Tasman Sea off NSW and off Tasmania using 30 year dataset (1992-present). (Note that the chemicals dataset can be found in Chemicals/Data in this repository.)

Code scripts:

-MapGraphics is to obtain a map with the Lat/Lon boxes used for analysis

-SST/30YrExplore.qmd is complete SST data processing and Heat Wave Analysis

-SST/anomalies Final.qmd is for obtaining SST anomalies map

-Chla/Chla_analysis_new.qmd is complete chlorophyll a data processing and timeseries plots

-Chemicals/Chemical.qmd is used to extract data from the CSV downloaded from AODN and plotted and analysis of subsurface chlorophyll a and chemicals data

-Chemicals/RefinedPlots.qmd creates the time trend of the stated chemicals and anomaly plots over the MHW event at depth of 20m and 80m for dissolved oxygen, silicate, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, and salinity measure on Maria Island NRS
